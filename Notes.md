TODO: WAIT UNTIL AFTER MEETING WITH PROF
----   

- StudentGroup.addScore()
- StudentGroup.changeName()
- StudentGroup.curveGrade()
- StudentGroup.getFinalScore()


COMMENTS:    
----
- Right now, there is main menu for quick testing of important functions. For the final submission, we could make this conform to what prof wants for output (???)
- addStudent() method is complete. try entering invalid values. Should be pretty bulletproof.
- Content of files scores1, scores2, scores3:
  - **scores1**: Points for quiz, points for homework
  - **scores2**: Points for final exam
  - **scores3**: Points for midterm, Points for make-up midterm
    (Extra points for handling repeated score type)
    (Extra points for flexibility, the heading "Points for make-up midterm"
    doesn't follow the naming convention)

IDEAS:    
----
- create a Unit Test Class. This would fulfill the "extra feature" for the last requirement of the project. The instructions also ask us to list our test cases.
  - We could follow best practices for creating a Test Class here:
