- Content of files scores1, scores2, scores3:
  - **scores1**: Points for quiz, points for homework
  - **scores2**: Points for final exam
  - **scores3**: Points for midterm, Points for make-up midterm
    (Extra points for handling repeated score type)
    (Extra points for flexibility, the heading "Points for make-up midterm"
    doesn't follow the naming convention)

IDEAS:
